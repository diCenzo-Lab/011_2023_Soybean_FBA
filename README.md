# A genome-scale metabolic reconstruction of soybean and *Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens* reveals the costâ€“benefit of nitrogen fixation

Holland BL, Matthew ML, Bota P, Sweetlove LJ, Long SP, diCenzo GC. (2023) **A genome-scale metabolic reconstruction of soybean and *Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens* reveals the cost-benefit of nitrogen fixation**. *New Phytologist*. 240(2): 744-756.

This repository contains a set of scripts used to perform the model reconstruction and analyses reported in the above article, and as described below. If you use adaptations of any of these scripts or pipelines as part of your work, please cite our article.

Analysis folder contains all code used to generate figures in Holland et al. 2023. The remaining directories are code required to construct the nodulated soybean FBA model as follows:
1. Produce_Plant
2. Produce_Nodule
3. Nodulate_Plant
4. Constrain_Nodule
5. Finalize_nodule

Similar directories exist for the construction of the amide & ureide exporting version of the soybean FBA model:
1. Combine_models
2. Constrain_nodule_amide
3. Finalize_nodule_amide

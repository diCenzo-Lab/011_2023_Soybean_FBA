# A genome-scale metabolic reconstruction of soybean and *Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens* reveals the costâ€“benefit of nitrogen fixation

Analysis folder contains all code used to generate figures in Holland et al. 2023
Remaining directories are code required to construct soybean FBA model as follows:
1. Produce_Plant
2. Produce_Nodule
3. Nodulate_Plant
4. Constrain_Nodule
5. Finalize_nodule

Similar directories exist for the construction of the amide & ureide exporting version of the soybean FBA model:
1. Combine_models
2. Constrain_nodule_amide
3. Finalize_nodule_amide
